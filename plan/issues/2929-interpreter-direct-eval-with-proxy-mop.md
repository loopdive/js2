# #2929 — Interpreter direct eval + `with` + Proxy-MOP convergence

Slice **F** of the runtime-eval roadmap
([docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md](../../docs/architecture/runtime-eval-interpreter.md), §6-F, §7).
#1584 Phase 2. Adds standalone **direct-eval scope capture** to the interpreter,
and — deliberately — builds the shared substrate (`with`, Proxy MOP) so those
tracks converge on it instead of re-deriving it.

## Scope

### 1. Standalone direct-eval scope capture
Add `LdName` / `StName` opcodes that resolve identifiers against a **reified
environment-record chain** (§4.1). Reuse the `$EnvRecord`/name-map carrier
introduced in the JS-host reification slice **#2925** (which extends #2864's
`$Frame` with a name map) — do NOT define a second environment type. This makes
`function f(){ var x=1; eval("x=2"); return x }` return `2` **standalone**,
mirroring the JS-host behavior #2925 delivers.

### 2. `with` (shared substrate, roadmap §7)
`with (obj) { … }` prepends an **object environment record** to the lexical
environment chain and resolves names against the object's properties — the same
chain the interpreter walks for direct eval, with one link being an arbitrary
object. Implement `with` as an object-environment-record variant of the §1
chain. (`with` is currently in the IR "deferred-feature" bucket alongside eval;
this is where it exits that bucket.)

### 3. Dynamic meta-object protocol (Proxy trap surface, roadmap §7)
The interpreter's generic property opcodes —
`Get`/`Set`/`GetByValue`/`HasProperty`/`OwnKeys`/`Delete` — must implement the
full ordinary-object internal methods (prototype chain + descriptor semantics)
on `any`-typed receivers. Build these as **reusable `$Object`-level MOP
primitives** so #1355's Proxy handler dispatch plugs into the *same* surface.
**This issue does not implement Proxy traps or edit #1355's files** — it exposes
the MOP primitives #1355 consumes, and coordinates their signatures with the
#1355 owner (roadmap §7).

### 4. Generator / async opcodes
`SuspendGenerator`/`ResumeGenerator`/`YieldValue`, aligned with the #2864/#2865
`$Frame` suspend/resume encoding (the interpreter's frame IS the #2864 carrier).

## Coordination (must-not-diverge)

Per roadmap §7, the `$EnvRecord` type (with #2925/#2864) and the MOP-primitive
signatures (with #1355) are reviewed **jointly with those owners before
implementation**, so one carrier and one MOP surface serve direct-eval, `with`,
and Proxy.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `function f(){ var x=1; eval("x=2"); return x }()` returns `2`
      **standalone** (interpreter direct-eval capture).
- [ ] `with ({a:1}) { a }` evaluates to `1` via the object-environment-record
      chain (standalone).
- [ ] The MOP primitives are consumed by at least one #1355 Proxy trap in a
      joint integration test (coordinated, not implemented here).
- [ ] A generator run through the interpreter suspends/resumes correctly using
      the #2864 `$Frame` carrier.
- [ ] Direct-eval scope tests pass identically via JS-host (#2925) and the
      standalone interpreter (differential check).

## Notes

Depends on #2928 (VM core), #2925 (env-record carrier), #2864 (`$Frame`).
Converges with #1355 (Proxy) and `with`. Umbrella: #1584. Goal: `runtime-eval`.

## 2026-08-02 implementation handoff

Branch `codex/2929-direct-eval-capture` implements a resumable direct-eval
interpreter checkpoint:

- an AOT function whose lexical descendants can reach direct `eval` promotes
  eval-visible locals to the compiler's existing canonical mutable capture
  cells;
- direct eval passes current-activation state, lexical captures, outer captures,
  strictness, and mapped-parameter metadata through the standalone provider
  boundary
  `__runtime_direct_eval(source, globalObject, thisArg, activationState, activationSeedNames, activationSeedSlots, lexicalNames, lexicalSlots, outerNames, outerSlots, callerStrict, mappedParamNames)`;
- the provider creates a declarative `$EnvRecord` above the global record, and
  interpreter name lookup, assignment, and `typeof` dereference those live
  cells; and
- writes therefore flow both ways without a copy-back pass. The standalone
  probes cover an ordinary function, a nested function declaration, a function
  expression, an arrow, non-string passthrough, the refusal provider, and the
  real zero-import Acorn provider.

The MVP mutation gate is green: a caller cell initialized to `40` is changed by
dynamic direct eval to `42`, and the probe observes both the eval result and the
subsequent AOT read (`42 + 42 = 84`). Existing indirect-eval and `new Function`
provider routes remain green.

The follow-on declaration/strictness slice is also present on the same branch:

- `EvalDeclarationInstantiation` now separates top-level `var`/function names,
  top-level lexical names, and nested block functions;
- strict direct eval inherits caller strictness across the provider ABI, while a
  source-level `"use strict"` directive is detected inside the runtime AST;
- strict eval receives a private declarative var environment, and top-level
  `let`/`const` bindings receive a private TDZ environment;
- `InitName` initializes those predeclared lexical cells without weakening
  ordinary assignment's TDZ and strict-unresolvable checks; and
- nested block functions use real block lexical environments, so their closures
  retain the correct environment without leaking after the block exits.

Three further MVP slices are included:

- **Activation persistence.** Each AOT activation owns a persistent eval overlay
  with capacity for 64 eval-created names. Sloppy top-level eval `var` and
  eligible Annex B block-function bindings survive later direct-eval calls in
  the same activation, while strict eval and lexical declarations remain
  isolated. Current-activation names, lexical captures, and outer captures are
  represented separately, so a new current-function `var` cannot overwrite an
  outer capture.
- **Mapped arguments.** Sloppy simple parameters and `arguments[index]` share
  the same backing cells across direct eval. The dispatcher preserves the raw
  source-level argument count while widening to declared arity, and the local
  snapshot restores the exact boxed capture map. Parameter-to-arguments and
  arguments-to-parameter canaries return `202` and `303`, respectively.
- **Block, Annex B, and class MVP.** Nested blocks create lexical environment
  records with TDZ, closure capture, and cleanup on normal exit, `break`,
  `continue`, and exceptions. Sloppy block functions implement bounded B.3.3
  outer-binding behavior, including lexical-conflict and skipped-block cases.
  Classes support declarations and expressions, default/explicit constructors,
  and ordinary noncomputed instance/static methods. Class bodies are strict and
  calling a class without `new` throws `TypeError`. Inheritance, fields, private
  names, accessors, computed names, and `super` fail loudly.

Class construction and method calls are green while the class remains inside
the interpreter. Returning an interpreted class through the provider and then
constructing it in a separately compiled AOT module still loses constructor
arguments/prototype state. That is the deferred generic external-callable /
cross-module rec-group ABI seam, not an interpreter class-semantics success;
this checkpoint does not claim it.

The real Acorn provider remains a zero-import standalone artifact. Its runtime
canaries cover sloppy caller mutation, strict-source and strict-caller var
isolation, lexical isolation and TDZ, strict early errors, indirect strict var
isolation, declaration-plan/environment construction, activation persistence,
mapped arguments, block shadowing/TDZ/closure capture, abrupt-completion
cleanup, Annex B block functions, and the bounded class surface above. The
focused Node environment suite is 18/18.

### Test262 eval-code measurement

The full standalone runtime-eval lane was measured with:

```sh
TEST262_TARGET=standalone \
TEST262_FULL_RUNTIME_EVAL=1 \
TEST262_PATH_FILTER=language/eval-code \
TEST262_REPORTER=dot \
pnpm run test:262
```

Result: **207 / 816 pass (25.4%)**, all 207 host-free.

| Scope | Pass | Total | Direct | Indirect |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Current standard | 130 | 347 | 97 / 286 | 33 / 61 |
| Annex B | 77 | 469 | 52 / 309 | 25 / 160 |
| Combined | 207 | 816 | 149 / 595 | 58 / 221 |

The 207-file passing surface is concentrated in these concrete families:

- direct and indirect non-string passthrough, `parse-failure-1..6`, and normal
  completion-value cases (`cptn-nrml-*`);
- strictness/isolation cases including direct `strict-caller-*`,
  `strictness-override`, both `block-decl-eval-source-is-strict-*` variants,
  indirect `always-non-strict` / `block-decl-strict`, and the passing strict
  `var-env-func-*`, `var-env-global-lex-*`, and `var-env-lower-lex-*` cases;
- the supported arrow/async arguments-declaration matrix where `arguments` is
  absent, a parameter, a `var`, or a function declaration (lexical-binding and
  several method/default-parameter shapes remain failures);
- direct global-environment/catch/eval/function cases, selected `this` and
  `super-call` cases, and direct/indirect import/export syntax checks; and
- 77 Annex B cases, primarily `*-block-scoping`, existing function/var
  no-initializer behavior, and the selected `*-skip-early-err-{block,for}`
  variants listed by the lane result.

Non-pass outcomes were 565 runtime failures, 16 compile errors, and 28 compile
timeouts. The leading runtime buckets were 349 assertion failures, 173 other
errors, 24 syntax errors, 14 illegal casts, 3 type errors, 1 negative-test
failure, and 1 null dereference; the 16 compile errors were reported as host
import leaks.

A maintained 56-test `var-env-*` / `lex-env-*` declaration cohort was measured
before and after this follow-on and remained **16 / 56** with no per-file status
changes. These Test262 inputs use literal eval sources and are currently handled
by the compiler's separate AOT `tryStaticEvalInline` path, so that cohort does
not exercise the runtime interpreter. The dynamic Acorn-provider canaries above
are the acceptance gate for this slice. A future interpreter-only Test262 score
needs an explicit maintained compile mode that prefers runtime eval; it must not
silently disable constant folding, because existing acceptance tests require
literal eval to remain provider-free.

The final post-merge full-lane A/B run (`20260802-075946`) remained **207 / 816** with the
exact same 207 passing files as the pre-slice baseline: zero pass-to-fail and
zero fail-to-pass transitions. Candidate non-pass outcomes were 569 runtime
failures, 16 compile errors, and 24 compile timeouts. The only four status
changes were Annex B files that moved from compile timeout to a known runtime
`ReferenceError`; they do not change the passing denominator. Current-standard
coverage remains 130/347 and Annex B remains 77/469.

### Remaining work, in recommended order

1. Complete dynamic mapped-arguments descriptor semantics: deleting or
   redefining an indexed property must sever the parameter alias exactly when
   required. The current MVP covers ordinary indexed reads/writes and direct
   parameter mutation, not every descriptor transition.
2. Extend lexical lowering to per-iteration loop environments, catch-parameter
   lexical bindings, and `switch`; extend classes with inheritance, fields,
   private names, accessors, computed names, and `super`.
3. Cover methods, async/generator functions, `new.target`, `super`, and strict-
   caller `this` behavior in the interpreter emitter/runtime. Freeze the
   external callable/constructor and rec-group ABI with the packaging owner
   before claiming classes returned across a module boundary.
4. Implement the object environment record for `with`, then coordinate the
   shared ordinary-object MOP surface with #1355 before adding Proxy traps.
5. Add generator suspend/resume opcodes on the shared #2864 frame carrier, then
   run the JS-host/standalone differential acceptance gate.

This branch is a resumable MVP slice, not closure of #2929. Only the first
acceptance checkbox is satisfied.
