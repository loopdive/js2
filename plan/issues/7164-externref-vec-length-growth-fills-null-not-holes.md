# #7164 — `g.length = 3` on an externref vec creates null elements

Found while implementing #7151 (PR #6918). Pre-existing on `origin/main`, gc
native-first and standalone (host-assisted correct):

```js
const g: any[] = []; g.push("y"); g.length = 3;
console.log(1 in g);          // true    (node: false)
console.log(String(g[1]));    // "null"  (node: "undefined")
g.sort(); console.log(g.join("|"));   // traps on the native lanes   (node: "y||")
```

## Cause (as diagnosed; verify before fixing)

The `length` setter growth path on `$__vec_externref` (`grep -rn "length" src/codegen/array-length*.ts src/codegen/array/`) extends storage with wasm null, and the element read / `in` / enumeration paths treat null as a present JS `null` instead of the `$Hole` sentinel the vec uses elsewhere (#7151 sorts holes last by testing `$Hole`). Typed numeric vecs have their own hole encoding; the externref vec must use `$Hole`.

## Implementation Plan (Fable, 2026-10-25; implement on Opus)

1. Reproduce the program plus `g.length = 0; g.length = 2`, `delete g[0]`, and `new Array(3)` on gc native-first and standalone; list which reads (index, `in`, `hasOwnProperty`, for-in, `join`, `sort`, `forEach` skip) are wrong.
2. Fill grown slots with the vec's `$Hole` sentinel (the same value `delete` and `new Array(n)` must produce — unify on one constructor helper); make `join` and `sort` treat a hole as empty / last as they already do for `$Hole`. Do not add host imports; host-assisted gc bytes unchanged.
3. Tests: `tests/issue-7164-externref-vec-length-growth.test.ts` with the programs from step 1 on gc native-first and standalone vs node.

Acceptance: node's output for all programs; no trap in `join` after `sort`; host-assisted gc bytes unchanged; equivalence gate no new regressions.
