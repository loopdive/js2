# 2026-09-20 (cluster D, #5197 R3-3): the `Promise.{all,race}.call(C, iterable)`
# arm in `compileNamespaceStaticCall` grows by 10 lines — the admission check plus
# the delegation to `tryEmitCustomCombinatorCall`. The protocol itself (≈700 LOC)
# lives in the NEW module `src/codegen/promise-custom-combinator.ts`, not in the
# god-file; this grant covers only the dispatch site that has to name it.
# 2026-09-20 (cluster H, arguments ordinary `length`) — +4 lines in
# `src/codegen/vec-overlay.ts`: two comment lines stating §10.4.4's rule, the
# one-line call that splices the arguments arm into `__vec_dp_value`'s
# `"length"` body, and the two `...argumentsLengthDefineArm` spreads at its two
# entry points. The arm BODY (and the descriptor-value reader beside it) lives
# in the length subsystem module `src/codegen/vec-length-descriptor.ts`, which
# exists for exactly this — "keep the brand-sensitive seed and descriptor reads
# out of the overlay emitter so the length implementation remains within its
# subsystem budget". Inlined in the overlay the same change was +77. What
# cannot move is the call site: the decision "an arguments receiver does not
# run ArraySetLength" has to be readable at the point ArraySetLength starts.
# 2026-09-20 — cluster A (native generator lowering, standalone). Two gate
# widenings in `generators-native.ts` (`this` in a generator function
# EXPRESSION; a generator-valued destructuring-param default in a zero-suspend
# method lane). +61 manifest rows pass, 0 regressions across a 617-row
# generator neighbourhood on BOTH targets. The growth is ~80 % comment: each
# widening reverses a bail whose prior rationale is recorded in place, so the
# measurement that overturns it is recorded next to it rather than in a commit
# message nobody reads at the bail site.
# 2026-09-20 — cluster B (String.prototype @@match/@@replace/@@search/@@split
# dispatch, standalone). The protocol itself (~290 LOC) lives in the NEW module
# `src/codegen/string-symbol-protocol.ts`; the only god-file growth is the
# dispatch site in `call-receiver-method.ts::compileReceiverMethodCall` that has
# to NAME it. The call site cannot move: §22.1.3 step 2 runs BEFORE the string
# lane, so the decision "this search value may carry a protocol method" has to
# be readable at the point the native string lane is entered, and the probe's
# fall-through arm IS that same lane re-entered through a closure.
# 2026-09-21 — cluster F (Proxy/Reflect, standalone). All three edits are inside
# the ONE standalone `Reflect.*` arm of `compileNamespaceStaticCall`
# (`nativeReflectProvider`), which is where each method's own answer is built;
# there is no seam to move them behind without splitting a god-function this
# slice does not otherwise touch. The growth is ~60 % comment: two of the three
# reverse a written-down claim that has gone STALE (the `setPrototypeOf` "KNOWN
# LIMITATION: the native has no failure channel" — #5148 built one; the
# `ownKeys` "the native runtime does not retain symbol-keyed properties yet" —
# it does), so the measurement that overturns each claim is recorded next to
# it rather than in a commit message nobody reads at the site.

# 2026-09-21 (cluster F) — the three new `__is_truthy` calls are not a
# hand-rolled coercion matrix. Each is literally the spec's ToBoolean on a
# [[SetPrototypeOf]] / [[PreventExtensions]] success bit (§28.1.14 step 4,
# §28.1.11 step 2), and each calls the SAME shared `__is_truthy` native that
# the neighbouring `Reflect.defineProperty` arm and the six #6494/#5316 proxy
# front guards already use to read exactly this kind of booleanish trap result.
# This makes the `Reflect` arms agree with one another rather than introducing
# a second rule — the same argument #6494 recorded for its own three.

# #6651 — ES2015 standalone → 100%: cluster execution plan

**Why a new file.** #4444 is the umbrella and its 2,800-line log is the
history. This file is the *dispatchable* plan: one census, nine clusters with
frozen row manifests, one owner/model/effort per cluster, and a uniform
acceptance recipe. Progress notes go under "Cluster status" below; narrative
stays in #4444.

## Census (authoritative, 2026-09-20)

Source: `loopdive/js2wasm-baselines` `test262-standalone-current.jsonl`,
fetched `--force` 2026-09-20 19:28 UTC, internal timestamp 2026-09-20 17:39,
`oracle_version: 14`, `oracle_lane: honest`, 48,735 rows, baseline_sha
`9dc2fa2e`. Edition classification:
`website/public/benchmarks/results/test262-file-editions.json` (index of
`ES2015` in its `editions` array).

| ES2015 standalone | rows |
| --- | ---: |
| total | 11,704 |
| pass | **10,384** (88.7 %) |
| fail | 1,034 |
| compile_error | 286 |
| **gap to 100 %** | **1,320** |

Edition-ratchet floor (`scripts/test262-edition-ratchet-baseline.json`,
2026-09-04): 10,131 — the baseline above is +253 over the floor.

### Top error signatures across the 1,320

| rows | status | signature |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 129 | CE | `standalone target emitted host imports: env::__create_generator, env::__gen_create_buffer, …` |
| 53 | CE | `native generator lowering currently supports only sequential numeric yields in standalone/WASI (#680)` |
| 79 | fail | `TypeError: Cannot access property on null or undefined` |
| 76 | fail | `Expected a TypeError to be thrown but no exception was thrown` |
| 47 | fail | `Expected a Test262Error to be thrown but no exception was thrown` |
| 42 | fail | `Expected a Test262Error but got a TypeError` |
| 48 | CE | `host imports: env::Promise_all / Promise_race / allSettled / any …` |
| 18 | fail | `Method called on incompatible receiver (RegExp brand check failed)` |
| 17 | fail | `Object.prototype.toString is not yet implemented in --target standalone` |
| 7 | CE | `host imports: env::Object_set_constructor` |
| 6 | CE | `standalone Reflect.construct cannot preserve an arbitrary distinct NewTarget` |

## Clusters — manifests, owners, models

Every cluster has a frozen path manifest under `plan/agent-context/6651/`
(one `test/`-relative path per line, derived mechanically from the census
above — see the partition rule in the manifest generator note at the bottom).
A cluster is done when **every** row in its manifest passes on the isolated
standalone runner and the acceptance recipe below is met.

| # | cluster | manifest | rows | CE / fail | owner lane | model / effort | blocking dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Native generator lowering: non-numeric yields, `yield` in destructuring/class/object bodies, `yield*`, try/catch | `A-generators-standalone.txt` | 197 | 197 / 0 | senior-developer | Opus, **max** | none — this is the largest single lever; unblocks ~60 more rows in C/G that currently hit the same gate |
| B | RegExp `Symbol.{match,replace,search,split}` protocol, `flags`, `exec` override, Annex B RegExp, `String.prototype.{match,search,split,replace}` dispatch | `B-regexp-protocol.txt` | 147 | 11 / 136 | senior-developer | Opus, high | coordinate with #5198 (in-progress, drafts #5393/#6014, held #5996) — read its handoff first, do not duplicate the `lastIndex` reader work |
| C | Class / object-literal / `super` semantics: class-call TypeError, `new.target`, method descriptors, subclass constructor return, computed keys | `C-class-object-super.txt` | 177 | 6 / 171 | senior-developer | Opus, high | #5318 / #5350 in-progress; draft #5839 documents the object-literal `super` blocker #6420 |
| D | Native Promise combinators: `Promise.all/race/allSettled/any` for non-literal/iterable args, `then` residuals, subclass ctor | `D-promise-combinators.txt` | 101 | 48 / 53 | developer | Opus, high | held PR #5883 (observable combinator protocol) — read, do not re-implement |
| E | TypedArray / ArrayBuffer / DataView: species, detached checks, `object-arg` ctors, `toLocaleString`, internals `[[Set]]`/`[[DefineOwnProperty]]`/`[[OwnPropertyKeys]]` | `E-typedarray-buffers.txt` | 144 | 1 / 143 | developer | Opus, high | none (#5317 done) |
| F | Proxy / Reflect: invariant must-throw, `Reflect.construct` distinct NewTarget, trap receiver/realm args | `F-proxy-reflect.txt` | 89 | 5 / 84 | senior-developer | Opus, high | #6494 in-review; drafts #5400 (NewTarget design) / #5397 (Reflect.set receiver) |
| G | for-of / destructuring runtime residuals, generator prototype objects, `Iterator.prototype.{chunks,windows}` (ES2015-tagged via `generators`) | `G-forof-destructuring-iterators.txt` | 134 | 2 / 132 | developer | Opus, high | after A lands (≈20 rows here are generator-shaped fails) |
| H | Builtins misc: `Array.prototype.concat` (isConcatSpreadable, #6485), `slice/splice/map` species, `Object.prototype.toString` runtime tag (#4119 gap), `Function.prototype.{toString,bind,@@hasInstance}`, `Error.prototype.stack`, `Symbol.prototype.@@toPrimitive`, `__proto__` | `H-builtins-misc.txt` | 217 | 6 / 211 | developer | Opus, high | #6485 in-progress (concat) |
| I | Language misc: module namespace internals (12), `with` + unscopables, `eval` spread, TCO rows, global-code var collision | `I-language-misc.txt` | 114 | 10 / 104 | developer | Opus, medium | several rows are eval/with (see #1066); triage first, file wont-fix with reason where standalone cannot honour |

Rows: 197+147+177+101+144+89+134+217+114 = 1,320. The manifests partition the
gap exactly; no row is in two clusters.

### Dispatch order and concurrency

The container that produced this plan has 4 cores, so at most 3 clusters run
concurrently. Order by rows-unlocked-per-effort:

1. **Wave 1 (now):** A (generators), D (promise combinators), H (builtins misc).
2. **Wave 2:** E (typed arrays), C (class/object/super), B (RegExp).
3. **Wave 3:** F (proxy/reflect), G (for-of, after A), I (language misc).

Every owner first re-runs its manifest on its branch base to get a **measured**
before-state (never quote this file's counts as the before-state — a base
moved under you is the #2916/#4433 defect).

## Acceptance recipe (every cluster, no exceptions)

```bash
# 1. before-state on the branch base, isolated standalone runner
npx tsx scripts/run-test262-paths.mts plan/agent-context/6651/<cluster>.txt \
  --standalone --isolate > .tmp/6651/<cluster>-before.log 2>&1; echo $?
# 2. implement; keep .tmp/base copies of every edited file at first edit
# 3. after-state, same command → <cluster>-after.log; both logs are the receipt
# 4. neighbourhood regression control: the sibling directories of every row
#    you changed behaviour for (e.g. all of built-ins/Promise/** for D), host
#    (default target) AND standalone, before vs after — zero pass→non-pass
# 5. gates, chained, before the commit (never --no-verify)
node scripts/check-loc-budget.mjs && node scripts/check-func-budget.mjs \
  && node scripts/check-coercion-sites.mjs && npm run -s check:oracle-ratchet \
  && npm run -s check:dead-exports && npx vitest run tests/equivalence.test.ts
```

- **No new host imports without a standalone fallback** (dual-mode rule).
  A cluster fix that converts a CE into a fail is progress only if the fail
  is a narrower, documented residual — record it.
- Growth allowances (LOC / func budget) go in this file's frontmatter, dated.
- Commits carry `Model:` and `Co-authored-by:` trailers per `AGENTS.md`.
- The owner writes its receipts (before/after counts, log paths, SHA of the
  manifest) under **Cluster status** below, not in #4444.

## Definition of done for #6651

- ES2015 standalone `pass == total` (11,704 / 11,704) on a full authoritative
  standalone run, or every remaining row has a `wont-fix` issue naming the
  spec-level reason (e.g. direct `eval` of dynamic text in a no-host target).
- `scripts/test262-edition-ratchet-baseline.json` ES2015 floor banked to the
  new number via `check:edition-ratchet:update` from a **full** run.
- #4444 gets a one-paragraph closing note pointing here.

## Cluster status

_(owners append here: date, branch, before → after, log paths, residuals)_

### 2026-09-20 — Cluster D (native Promise combinators), slice D1: custom-constructor `.call`

- **Branch** `worktree-agent-a6d336193709ec50a`, base `claude/es2015-test262-plan-54tooh`
  (`905dca75`). **Worktree** `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-a6d336193709ec50a`.
- **Manifest** `plan/agent-context/6651/D-promise-combinators.txt` (101 rows),
  `--standalone --isolate`, measured on this branch's own base:

  | | pass | fail | compile_error |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
  | before (`.tmp/6651/D-before.log`) | 0 | 55 | 46 |
  | after (`.tmp/6651/D-after.log`) | **26** | 57 | **18** |

  Every one of the 28 compile errors in the targeted cohort is gone: 26 of them
  now PASS, 2 became documented fails (below). The fail count rises by exactly
  those 2 — no row that executed before stopped executing.

- **What landed.** `Promise.{all,race}.call(C, iterable)` for an ORDINARY
  compiled constructor now runs the §27.2.4.1.1 / §27.2.4.3.1 element protocol
  natively (new `src/codegen/promise-custom-combinator.ts`): NewPromiseCapability
  over `C`, one `Get(C, "resolve")`, per-element `Call(resolve, C, «value»)` and
  `Invoke(next, "then", …)`, with real per-index resolve-element functions
  (builtin-fn-meta carrier, `[[AlreadyCalled]]`, `[[RemainingElements]]`), and
  IfAbruptRejectPromise on any abrupt element step. Before this, that whole
  shape fell through to the unsatisfiable `env::Promise_all`/`env::Promise_race`
  host import, so the rows did not compile at all. The narrow #4682 empty-array
  arm stays as the fallback for `allSettled`/`any` and refused constructors.
  Two sub-fixes were needed and are load-bearing:
  1. `C` is invoked through `__apply_closure`, not a baked `call_ref` — every
     row in the cohort writes a static (`C.resolve = …`), which moves the
     identifier's value onto the `$Object` function carrier; the `call_ref`
     path found a null funcref and threw the capability TypeError before `C`
     ran (measured `checkPoint === 0`).
  2. An array of object literals compiles to a vec of the CLOSED STRUCT type,
     which `__combinator_to_vec` answers null for. Those are re-materialized
     into the canonical externref vec instead of being called "not iterable"
     (that alone was 9 of the 28 rows).

- **Neighbourhood control** — all 729 `built-ins/Promise/**` rows, `--standalone`,
  before vs after (`.tmp/6651/neigh-standalone-{before,after}.log`):
  pass **359 → 385**, fail 204 → 206, compile_error 166 → 138.
  Per-row set diff: **0 pass → non-pass**, 26 non-pass → pass.
- **Host (gc) lane**: the non-isolated host run of that directory cannot be used
  as a control — one row poisons `Promise.all` in the runner's own realm and
  kills the process (`src/runtime.ts:17502 … PROMISE_INTRINSICS.all?.call`).
  Substituted a stronger check where it applies: a sha256 byte comparison of 8
  compiled programs (3 custom-constructor `.call` shapes, 4 intrinsic
  combinator shapes, a `.then` chain) on base vs branch —
  **all 8 host binaries byte-identical** (`.tmp/6651/hostbytes-{before,after}.txt`).
  On standalone the same corpus shows exactly the intended delta: the 3
  custom-constructor programs change (and lose all host imports), the 5
  intrinsic ones are byte-identical (`.tmp/6651/sabytes-{before,after}.txt`).
- **Unit tests**: new `tests/issue-6651-promise-custom-combinator.test.ts`
  (8 cases: values array, deferred `[[RemainingElements]]`, race handler
  identity, zero-arg-ctor TypeError, throwing ctor, both IfAbruptRejectPromise
  arms, host-lane control). `tests/issue-4682.test.ts` — the
  "keeps the non-empty custom-constructor fallback unchanged" case asserted the
  shape still leaked `env.Promise_all`; it is REWRITTEN to assert the native
  lowering. The 3 failures in `tests/promise-combinators.test.ts` (2 timeouts)
  and `tests/issue-2671-promise-capability.test.ts` reproduce IDENTICALLY on the
  base tree (`.tmp/promise-suite-{before,after}.log`) — pre-existing, host-lane.
- **Gates**: loc-budget and func-budget pass with the grants added to this file's
  frontmatter (+12 LOC / +11 func LOC at the dispatch site only); coercion-sites,
  oracle-ratchet, dead-exports, compiler-boundaries `--mode inventory` (the new
  module is classified in `scripts/compiler-boundaries.json`) and
  `scripts/equivalence-gate.mjs` (22 known failures, no new) all pass.

**Residual sub-buckets (18 CE + 57 fail on the manifest), with signatures:**

| rows | status | sub-bucket | why it is still open |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | CE | `{all,race,allSettled,any}/resolve-throws-iterator-return-*` — `env::Promise_*` | the receiver is a `class BadPromise {…}`; standalone has no `Construct(C, «executor»)` for a compiled class (#5197 G10, DEFERRED there) |
| 6 | CE | `{all,race,resolve,reject}/ctx-ctor.js`, `*/invoke-resolve-on-promises-every-iteration-of-custom` — `env::__promise_subclass_ctor` | `class X extends Promise` receiver (#5197 G9, DEFERRED) |
| 4 | CE | `{all,race}/invoke-resolve-on-{promises,values}-every-iteration-of-promise` — `env::Promise_{all,race}` | INTRINSIC receiver with a reassigned `Promise.resolve` over an f64/promise vec — #5197 R3-2 step 6, the half held PR #5883 implements |
| ~20 | fail | `invoke-resolve*`, `invoke-then*`, `resolve-not-callable-*`, `resolve-poisoned-then` | the observable intrinsic `Get(C,"resolve")`/`Invoke(then)` pipeline (R3-2 / PR #5883) — deliberately NOT duplicated here |
| ~10 | fail | `*-close`, `iter-step-err-reject`, `iter-next-val-err-reject`, `S25.4.4.*_A5.1` | the iterable is drained before the element loop, so `IteratorClose` never runs and a throwing `next()` surfaces as "argument is not iterable" (R3-4) |
| 1 | fail | `all/capability-resolve-throws-no-close.js` — `Expected SameValue(«0», «1»)` | NEW in this slice's scope: the iterable is `iter[Symbol.iterator] = fn` on an `$Object`; `__combinator_to_vec` does not see the symbol-keyed expando, so the aggregate rejects "not iterable" and `nextCount` stays 0 (R3-4 hypothesis H1) |
| 1 | fail | `all/resolve-element-function-prototype.js` — `JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs … provider is not built` | environment only: the quickjs provider is not built in this container, so the row is unverifiable locally (it exercises `Object.getPrototypeOf(resolveElementFunction)`) |
| rest | fail | `then`/species/`constructor` reads, `Object.prototype.toString` tag, boolean handler boxing | #5197 R3-5…R3-10 and #4119 — untouched by this slice |

**Not started in this slice (and why):** the runtime-fail half of cluster D is
the observable-protocol work of held PR #5883 (#5197 R3-2), which the brief
explicitly says not to duplicate; the class-receiver CEs need a standalone
`Construct` for compiled classes, which is a separate mechanism, not a
combinator change.

### H — builtins misc (2026-09-20, Opus lane)

- Branch `worktree-agent-a5c18a3e8a3d3a0fd`, worktree
  `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-a5c18a3e8a3d3a0fd`, based on
  `claude/es2015-test262-plan-54tooh` (905dca75).
- Manifest `plan/agent-context/6651/H-builtins-misc.txt`, sha256
  `f1eb655415155ac7e7d262ffbaa50a479f8a495bdeb297fad7292169811c104f`, 217 rows.

**Before → after on the manifest** (isolated standalone runner, one row per
child process; logs `.tmp/6651/H-{before,after}.tsv`):

| | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before | 0 | 211 | 6 |
| after | **3** | 208 | 6 |

Per-row diff: **3 gained, 0 lost, 0 other verdict changes** —
`Array.prototype.concat_{sloppy-arguments,sloppy-arguments-with-dupes,
strict-arguments}.js`.

**What landed: an `arguments` object's `length` is an ORDINARY property
(§10.4.4), on all three surfaces.** The assignment half already modelled this
(`member-set-dispatch.ts`, `vec-length-set.ts` arm 1: store the value in the
`$__arguments_vec` override fields, leave the index domain alone). Three
surfaces disagreed with it, each measured on the base tree:

1. `Object.defineProperty(args, "length", {value: 6})` ran Array ArraySetLength
   (`__vec_dp_value`), which GREW the physical backing; the new tail read back
   as wasm null — JS `null`, not `undefined` — and `4 in args` answered `true`
   for a slot that is not an own property.
2. `__extern_length` (the array-like length every generic spec loop reads) read
   field 0, so `[].concat(args)` after `args.length = 6` produced three
   elements where §23.1.3.1 wants six (three values + three holes).
3. `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(args, "length").value` answered the
   physical count (3) while `args.length` answered 6 — the same property, the
   same module, two answers.

Files: `src/codegen/vec-length-descriptor.ts` (both new builders — the
subsystem module for brand-sensitive length descriptor reads),
`src/codegen/vec-length-set.ts` (`spliceArgumentsExternLengthArm`),
`src/codegen/vec-overlay.ts` (+4 lines: the two call sites). Pin file
`tests/issue-6651-arguments-ordinary-length.test.ts` — 5 cases, **3 verified
RED on the base tree**, 2 are guards (green both sides), including the negative
direction (an untouched arguments object must keep the physical length).

**Neighbourhood control** — `built-ins/Array/prototype/concat` (all 69 rows) +
the 53 `language/arguments-object` rows that write/define/delete `length` or
run `verifyProperty`, standalone, before vs after on the same machine
(`.tmp/6651/ctl-{before,after}.tsv`): `95 pass / 26 fail / 1 CE` →
`98 / 23 / 1`, **0 pass → non-pass**, no other verdict changes.

**Host (default target) control is a byte-identity proof, not a sample.** Both
arms are standalone-gated (`ctx.externGetIdxReserved` / `ctx.standalone`), so
the honest control is that host output cannot move: the 13-file
`website/playground/examples` corpus compiles byte-identically on **gc and
standalone** before vs after (26/26 sha256 equal), and a module that exercises
exactly this construct (`arguments` + `length` write + define + concat +
gOPD) is byte-identical on **gc** (`31006917fced63c6` both sides) while its
standalone output changes (`0d2af224b558c195` → `f04025b3dd538141`).

Gates, bare: loc-budget OK (+4 in `vec-overlay.ts`, granted in this file's
frontmatter above, dated), func-budget OK, coercion-sites OK, oracle-ratchet OK
(`getTypeAtLocation +0`, `ctx.checker +0`), dead-exports OK, typecheck OK,
prettier OK, `biome lint --diagnostic-level=error` OK.
`node scripts/equivalence-gate.mjs`: **22 failing / 1720 passing, all 22 already
in `scripts/equivalence-baseline.json` — no new equivalence regressions.** (The
bare `vitest run tests/equivalence` OOMs in this container, as the project docs
warn; the gate's single-fork run is the supported way to score it.)

#### Residuals — what the other 214 rows are

Two thirds of this cluster is not "builtins misc" at all:

- **63 rows are not measurable in this container**: they need the runtime-eval
  provider (`JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs`, artifact not built here) — mostly
  the `$262.createRealm` family. Before and after were measured with the SAME
  engine, so the delta is comparable; the absolute cause mix is not
  CI-comparable.
- **53 further rows are realm- or Proxy-dependent by source inspection**
  (`createRealm` / `new Proxy` / `Proxy.revocable` in the test body) —
  `proto-from-ctor-realm*`, `Symbol/*/cross-realm`, `create-proxy`,
  `Function/prototype/toString/proxy-*`. Cross-realm intrinsics have no
  standalone representation today; these belong with cluster F's Proxy work or
  a `wont-fix` with the realm reason, not here.
- **101 rows are core-measurable** and fragment into buckets of ≤5, the largest
  being: `Expected a TypeError … no exception` (5, builtin-method
  not-a-constructor + frozen-target `Object.assign`), `Expected a Test262Error
  but got a TypeError` (5, Map/WeakMap iterable-entry abrupt completions),
  bound-function `new.target` (5), `target-array-with-non-writable-property`
  species rows (4), `Array.prototype.flat` standalone CE (3), the
  `Object.prototype.toString` standalone refusal (3, all needing a runtime
  `@@toStringTag` Get honouring `delete`), and ~25 singletons.

Measured findings worth the next lane's time (each reproduced on the base tree
with a standalone probe, none fixed here):

- **Symbol-keyed ACCESSOR `defineProperty` on a vec carrier is silently
  dropped.** `Object.defineProperty(arr, Symbol.isConcatSpreadable, {get})`
  leaves `arr[Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]` `undefined` and never fires the
  getter, while the same descriptor on a plain object works and a plain
  symbol-keyed assignment on the array works. Cause: the vec overlay's
  `stringKeyGuard` BAILS on a non-string key, and the bail returns from
  `__defineProperty_value`/`_accessor` outright. This is #6485's recorded
  `is-concat-spreadable-get-order` residual, now localised.
- **`__extern_length` answers 0 for non-`$Object` object carriers.** A
  spreadable `new String("yuck")` concats to `[]`; a spreadable function with
  `length = 3` is not spread at all. The `$Object` array-like arm
  (`ToLength(Get(O,"length"))`) has no counterpart for wrapper / closure /
  RegExp carriers — deliberately not widened here, because it changes the
  array-like length of every such receiver and needs its own control set.
- **`Object.assign(Symbol(), …)` does not box**: `typeof` stays `"symbol"` and
  `Object(sym) === sym`. ToObject has no Symbol-wrapper carrier.
- **`Object("hi").length` is 0** while `new String("xy").length` is 2 — the
  ToObject path builds a different carrier from the constructor path.
- **`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Object.prototype, "__proto__")`** works
  (#5268) but `get.call({})` answers `null` rather than `Object.prototype`, and
  `set.call(o, proto)` does not make `getPrototypeOf(o)` that proto — an
  object-model gap, not an accessor gap.

### 2026-09-20 — Cluster A (native generator lowering, standalone), slice 1

- **Branch** `worktree-agent-ad71a322a90a0a605`, based on
  `claude/es2015-test262-plan-54tooh` @ `905dca75`.
  **Worktree** `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-ad71a322a90a0a605`.
  A second, source-clean worktree `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/measure-6651-A`
  (detached at the same commit) held every before-run — the first attempt
  measured the base with the runner reading the *edited* tree underneath it,
  which is not a before-state.
- **Manifest** `plan/agent-context/6651/A-generators-standalone.txt`, 197 rows,
  sha256 `5fc1a7c0c1d5672aba427f347ea225633e0c95cfa6e9547240fcc2cda2d62d77`.

| standalone, `--isolate` | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before (`.tmp/6651/A-before.log`) | **1** | 1 | 195 |
| after (`.tmp/6651/A-after.log`) | **62** | 2 | 133 |

**+61 rows pass, 0 pass → non-pass.** The one other movement is
`language/expressions/yield/star-in-rltn-expr.js`, compile_error → fail — a
narrower, documented residual (it now builds and gets a wrong first `value`).

#### What changed, and why it was bailed before

Both edits are in `src/codegen/generators-native.ts`; both reverse a *bail*, and
neither adds a host import.

1. **A1 — `this` inside a generator function EXPRESSION (41 rows).**
   `isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape` refused any `this` in the body, so
   `Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function*(){ … this.length … }` — the
   shape the whole `dstr/*-array-prototype` fixture family is built on — fell to
   the eager-buffer host path and leaked `env::__gen_*` into a standalone
   binary. #5255 had already solved the same problem for free *declarations*:
   snapshot the receiver into a frame field (`dynamic_this`) in the FACTORY and
   restore it as the resume function's `this` local. The bail's own comment said
   fn-exprs were excluded because "their closure ABI supplies a different
   capture carrier" — but `this` is not a capture (a non-arrow function
   expression rebinds it per call), so the `__self` struct and the receiver
   never compete. The factory here IS the lifted closure, whose `this` resolves
   through the `__current_this` global that `__call_fn_method_N` installs around
   the dispatch, i.e. exactly where §10.2.1 binds it.
   The load-bearing property is the *snapshot*, not "it compiles": a generator
   body runs on a later `.next()`, long after that global is restored. The
   `tests/issue-6651-generator-expression-this.test.ts` case "the receiver
   SURVIVES a suspension" is the one that fails if the receiver is read lazily.
   `super` keeps the bail (no [[HomeObject]] slot in the frame), and the two
   `this`-scans must agree before admitting — `fnExprBodyReferencesThis`
   descends into class bodies while `bodyReferencesOwnThis`, which arms the
   snapshot, stops there.
2. **A2 — a generator-valued destructuring-param default in a zero-suspend
   method lane (20 rows).** `buildNativeGeneratorPlan` bailed on every
   `[g = function*(){}]` param default. #4769 had already admitted a
   *class*-valued default on exactly one precondition — the method must not
   yield, so the value never crosses a suspension — and the #3952 note left the
   generator arm as "a measured, bounded follow-up", declining to admit it on
   lane identity alone. This is that measurement. A **yielding** method still
   takes the host path, and the generator function-expression host keeps its
   blanket bail for the reason recorded there (that lane mishandles element
   defaults with no closure involved at all, so admitting would swap a loud
   leak for a silent wrong value). Both halves are pinned by tests.

#### Neighbourhood regression control — zero pass → non-pass

617 rows: all of `language/expressions/generators`,
`language/statements/generators`, `built-ins/GeneratorPrototype`. The 8
`*array-prototype*` rows poison the realm, so they ran `--isolate`; the other
609 ran in-process, before and after, on both targets.

| lane | before | after | flips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| standalone, 609 in-process | 512 / 56 / 41 | 512 / 56 / 41 | none |
| host (default), 609 in-process | 521 pass / 88 fail | 521 / 88 | none |
| standalone, 8 isolated | 4 pass / 4 CE | **8 pass** | +4, none lost |
| host, 8 isolated | 4 pass / 4 fail | 4 / 4 | none |

Logs: `.tmp/6651/nb-{sa,host}-{before,after}.log`,
`.tmp/6651/nbiso-{sa,host}-{before,after}.log`.

Also green: `npm run -s typecheck`; the 11 generator-adjacent unit suites
(`generators`, `generator-iife`, `generator-method-destructuring`,
`generator-yield-contexts`, `issue-3032`, `issue-3164`, `issue-3302`,
`issue-3386`, `issue-3952`, `issue-4769`, `issue-5255`) — 94/94; and
`tests/equivalence`, 217 of its 218 files (run in small batches — the whole
suite OOMs on this box, and `multi-file-compilation.test.ts` OOMs on its own,
**identically on the base commit**, so it is an environment limit, not a
finding). Equivalence has **22 failing cases, every one of which reproduces on
the base commit** in the clean worktree: `arguments-nested-and-loops` (1),
`array-inline-return` (1), `delete-sentinel` (1), `logical-conditional-identity`
(3), `new-non-constructor` (2), `null-dereference-guards` (5), `reflect-api`
(1), `tdz-reference-error` (6), `yield-as-expression` (1),
`misc-small-patterns` (1). None is attributable here. The last two were
re-checked individually rather than assumed, because both name shapes this
change touches (`yield`; a named function expression's own-name binding).

#### Residual sub-buckets (135 rows), with signatures

| rows | signature | what it needs |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 74 | `standalone target emitted host imports: env::__gen_*` | see split below |
| 53 | `native generator lowering currently supports only sequential numeric yields … (#680)` | `yield` nested inside an assignment PATTERN |
| 6 | `'yield' is a reserved word …` | decorator-syntax rows; not a generator gap |
| 1 | `fail` — wrong first `value` | `language/expressions/yield/star-in-rltn-expr.js` (was CE) |
| 1 | `fail` — invalid module, `__gen_resume_g` `local.tee` type | `yield-star-before-newline.js`; **pre-existing, byte-identical before and after** |

The 53 `#680` rows plus 37 of the 74 leaks are **one family, 90 rows**:
`[ x = yield ] = vals` / `for ([ {} = yield ] of …)` — a `yield` suspension
*inside* a destructuring-assignment pattern, which `lowerStatements` reaches as
an unmodeled `ExpressionStatement` (17) or `ForOfStatement` (20). **Do not
start here expecting passes:** a host-lane probe of 8 of these rows failed
8/8, so the generator lowering is not their only blocker. (Same probe: 8/8 of
the A1 family and 8/8 of the A2 family passed on the host — which is exactly
why those two were picked first, and it is the cheapest triage available: a
row that fails on the host cannot be made to pass by fixing standalone-only
lowering.)

The other 37 leaks are small, independent gates in
`isNativeGeneratorExpressionShape` / `isNativeGeneratorCandidate`:

| rows | gate |
| ---: | --- |
| 16 | generator function-expression host, ANY closure-valued param default (the `ts.isFunctionExpression(decl)` arm — blocked by that lane's pre-existing plain-numeric-default defect, #3952, which must be fixed first) |
| 9 | named fn-expr whose body references its OWN name (`bodyReferencesOwnName`) — needs the immutable self-name binding, incl. its strict-mode TypeError on reassignment |
| 5 | computed-name generator methods (`{ [k]*(){} }`) — blocked on a stable emitted-name derivation |
| 4 | rest / optional params (2 in the object-method gate, 2 in the fn-expr gate) |
| 2 | `super` or an outer-scope capture in an object-literal method |
| 1 | duplicate method name within one class/object literal |

Method used, for the next owner: `isNativeGeneratorCandidate` /
`buildNativeGeneratorPlan` were temporarily instrumented (every `return
false`/`null` tagged with its line, `fail()` tagged with its caller from the
stack, plus the unmodeled statement's `SyntaxKind` + source text) and the
manifest was run through a **compile-only** probe. That turns "197 compile
errors" into a per-gate histogram in ~8 minutes instead of a 40-minute runner
pass, and it is how the three buckets above were sized before any code changed.
The instrumentation is not committed.

### 2026-09-21 — Cluster B (RegExp Symbol.\* protocol, standalone), slice B1: `String.prototype` @@-dispatch

- **Branch** `issue-6651-cluster-B-regexp`, based on
  `claude/es2015-test262-plan-54tooh` @ `9b1ff0dc`.
  **Worktree** `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-a35ed687b8f0ef175`.
- **Manifest** `plan/agent-context/6651/B-regexp-protocol.txt`, 147 rows,
  sha256 `f34bba06f50029156d5fb0cf36bb4f7da0c670b8645cdd35136dec9916a90b61`.
- Coordinated against **#5198** (Codex lane): its Slices A–C (observable
  `RegExpExec`/custom `exec`, `lastIndex`, the `flags` getter) and the Annex B
  compile-syntax work are UNTOUCHED here. This slice is #5198's **Slice D**,
  which had no in-flight branch.

| standalone, `--isolate`, 147 rows | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before (`.tmp/6651/B-before.log`) | **0** | 136 | 11 |
| after (`.tmp/6651/B-after.log`) | **7** | 129 | 11 |

**+7 rows pass; every one of the other 140 rows keeps its exact status** (the
two logs were joined row-by-row, not just compared by count). No compile_error
became a fail and no fail became a compile_error.

#### What changed, and why the previous answer was wrong rather than missing

One new module, `src/codegen/string-symbol-protocol.ts`, plus a 10-line
dispatch site in `call-receiver-method.ts`. No new host import — the probe is
built from natives the object runtime already exports (`__extern_get`,
`__box_symbol`, `__typeof_function`, `__objvec_new/push`, `__apply_closure`).

§22.1.3 step 2 of `match`/`replace`/`search`/`split` is
`GetMethod(searchValue, @@<protocol>)`, and `string-search-value.ts` (#4016)
answered it **statically**, with
`ctx.oracle.wellKnownSymbolMemberOf(v, protocol) === false`. That proof is
exact for a primitive and for a builtin RegExp, and **unsound for an ordinary
object** — the idiom the step exists for installs the method *after* the object
is created (`var regexp = {}; regexp[Symbol.search] = f`), where no declared
type can see it. So the old lowering took the step-3 lane instead and ran
`RegExpCreate(ToString(regexp))`, i.e. the pattern `"[object Object]"`. The
four `cstm-*-invocation` rows therefore reported
`TypeError: Unsupported dynamic regular expression pattern`, **which reads like
a missing engine feature and was actually the compiler stringifying a value it
was required to call.** That is the reason this bucket was worth taking before
the much larger `exec`-protocol buckets: it was mis-signposted, not merely
unimplemented.

Two things the implementation had to get right, both measured rather than
assumed:

1. **The gate must admit `{kind:"class"}`, not just `{kind:"object"}.** test262
   rows are **JS**, so TypeScript's expando inference gives `var regexp = {}` an
   anonymous type whose symbol carries the VARIABLE's name — and `factOfType`
   reports `{kind:"class", name:"regexp"}`. The first cut gated on `object`
   alone: it compiled and fired under a hand-written `.ts` probe and **never
   fired under the runner**, so the focused 17-row slice came back
   byte-identical. The `.ts` probe alone would have shipped a no-op.
2. **The probe must not leak its `externref` carrier into a typed consumer.**
   The branch's result type is externref (the protocol method may return
   anything), while the fall-through arm produces the native carrier —
   `const parts: string[] = "a,b".split(sep)` is the shape that catches a leak,
   because it compiles green and fails at `WebAssembly.instantiate`. It is
   pinned as a control. (A first attempt at that control used a dynamic
   symbol-keyed assignment and hit a **pre-existing, unrelated** invalid-module
   bug — `local.set expected (ref null 6), found (ref null 46)` — reproduced
   byte-identically on the base commit by a one-`cp` revert, so it is not
   attributable here and the control was rewritten.)

Both arms are re-emitted from the same AST, so the gate additionally requires
the receiver, search value and extra argument to be **re-evaluable without
observable effect** (identifier / `this` / literal). A computed operand keeps
the previous behaviour rather than risking a doubled side effect.

#### Neighbourhood regression control — zero pass → non-pass

The blast radius is provably bounded: the hook can only fire on a
`String.prototype.{match,replace,search,split}` call. The full 2,280-row
`built-ins/RegExp/**` + `annexB/built-ins/RegExp/**` +
`built-ins/String/prototype/{match,matchAll,replace,replaceAll,search,split}/**`
sweep was therefore filtered to the **512 rows whose source contains such a
call or a `[Symbol.<protocol>]` reference** — sound because none of the 2,280
rows includes one of the three harness files that call those methods
(`iteratorZipUtils`, `temporalHelpers`, `testIntl`), checked rather than
assumed. Run in 128-row chunks, one fresh process each: the single 2,280-row
in-process run **OOMs** at ~8 GB after ~27 min, which is a property of the
runner, not a finding.

| lane | rows | before | after | flips |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| standalone (`.tmp/6651/nbr-{before,after}.tsv`) | 512 | 161 non-pass | **154 non-pass** | the 7 target rows only; **0 regressions** |
| host — compiled-binary sha256 of 7 representative programs | 7 | — | — | **all 7 byte-identical** (`.tmp/6651/hostsha-{before,after}.txt`) |
| standalone — same 7 programs | 7 | — | — | **6 byte-identical**; only `split-object` differs, which is the admitted shape |

The host lane is byte-identical by construction too — `noJsHost(ctx)` is the
probe's first condition — but the sha comparison is the evidence, not the
argument.

Also green: `npm run -s typecheck`; the five ratchet gates
(`check-loc-budget`, `check-func-budget`, `check-coercion-sites`,
`check:oracle-ratchet`, `check:dead-exports`); `scripts/equivalence-gate.mjs`
(22 failing / 1720 passing, all 22 in the committed baseline — no new
regressions); and the new pin suite
`tests/issue-6651-string-symbol-protocol.test.ts`, 9/9.

#### Residual sub-buckets (140 rows), with signatures

| rows | signature | owner / what it needs |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 44 | `Expected a Test262Error … no exception` / `… but got a TypeError` | the observable **`RegExpExec`** substrate — `Get(R,"exec")`, call a callable override, propagate its abrupt completion. **#5198 Slice B** (draft PR #5393). Do not start here. |
| 18 | `Method called on incompatible receiver (RegExp brand check failed)` | `RegExp.prototype[@@x].call(plainObjWithExec, …)` is spec-legal; widening `recoverRegExpStructFromExternref` only helps once the row can then run a user `exec`, so it is **downstream of Slice B**, not independent. |
| 8 | `Expected a TypeError … no exception` | same family, TypeError-shaped assertions |
| 7 | `JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs … provider is not built` | **environment, not the compiler** — the 7 `*/cross-realm.js` + `proto-from-ctor-realm.js` rows need a built QuickJS provider in this container. Unmeasurable here; #5198 records them failing on host too. |
| 7 | CE `standalone target emitted host imports: env::Object_set_constructor` | 6 of 7 are `Symbol.split/species-ctor*` — `SpeciesConstructor` needs a `constructor` write on a plain object. #5198 Slice C4/E. |
| 5 | `flags` coercion (`built-ins/RegExp/prototype/flags/coercion-*`) | the **generic** `flags` getter: accept any Object, ordered `ToBoolean(Get(R, …))`. #5198 **Slice F**; fails on host too. |
| 4 | `Unsupported dynamic regular expression pattern` | the runtime pattern compiler. 2 are the `cstm-*-is-null` rows, which reach the ToString lane correctly now and then need `\d` from `__regex_compile_dynamic_simple`. |
| 3 | CE `… does not support String.prototype.match with dynamic RegExp flags` | `@@match` must read flags at RUNTIME. #5198 Slice C2. |
| 3 | `Expected true but got false` at `assert.notSameValue(originalSearch, undefined)` | `invoke-builtin-{search,match}*` — needs `RegExp.prototype[@@x]` to be a **reified, replaceable** method object, so the step-3 RegExp lane dispatches through it. Strictly harder than this slice. |
| 1 | CE, `String.prototype.replace/cstm-replace-get-err.js` | reachable and **deliberately left**: `"".replace(poisoned)` has ONE argument, and `tryCompileStandaloneStringValueReplace` requires exactly two, so the fall-through arm cannot lower and the `#1474` refusal is still reported. The fix is to admit an absent `replaceValue` as the literal `"undefined"` (§22.1.3.19 step 3) — a separate behaviour change for one row, which would have invalidated this slice's measured after-state. |
| 40 | assorted `Expected SameValue(…)` | per-method result-shape and cursor residuals across `@@replace` (30 rows), `@@split` (30), `@@match` (23), `@@search` (13) — #5198 Slices C1–C4. |

### 2026-09-21 — Cluster F (Proxy / Reflect, standalone), slice F1: the discarded booleans

- **Branch** `issue-6651-cluster-F-proxy-reflect`, based on
  `claude/es2015-test262-plan-54tooh` @ `a68e20f7`.
  **Worktree** `/home/user/js2/.claude/worktrees/agent-a883e5b95a1723f67`.
- **Manifest** `plan/agent-context/6651/F-proxy-reflect.txt`, 89 rows, sha256
  `3edd7052b503ee48f0022a8bc2f5c041a116228d19ef65d31bf2aeb54cf80dd7`.

| standalone, `--isolate`, 89 rows | pass | fail | compile_error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before (`.tmp/6651/F-before.log`) | **0** | 84 | 5 |
| after (`.tmp/6651/F-after.log`) | **7** | 77 | 5 |

**+7 rows pass; every other row keeps its exact status** (the two logs were
joined per path, not compared by count). No compile_error became a fail and no
fail became a compile_error.

**23 of the 89 rows are environment-unmeasurable in this container** —
`*-realm*` / `cross-realm`, which need `$262.createRealm` and the QuickJS eval
provider (`JS2WASM_EVAL_ENGINE=quickjs … provider is not built`). They were
measured, not assumed, and they fail identically before and after, so the delta
is comparable; their absolute cause mix is not CI-comparable. The honest
denominator for this slice is therefore **66 rows, of which 7 now pass.**

#### Triage method — the whole 66-row measurable set was probed on the HOST lane first

Cluster A's cheapest-triage rule, applied to every measurable row rather than 8
per bucket (same order of cost, complete answer): **32 of 66 PASS on the default
target**, so those are standalone-only lowering gaps and are reachable; 14 fail
on host too and need work in both lanes; 16 answer `error` on host (the row
kills its own child process). Every row this slice converted is in the host-pass
set. Log: `.tmp/6651/F-host-before.tsv`.

#### What changed — three discarded values and one fold that outranked a write

Each of the first three is a value the runtime had **already computed correctly**
and the call site then threw away. None is a new mechanism; two of them overturn
a comment that had gone stale, which is why they were mis-signposted as "not
implemented" rather than "not read".

1. **`Reflect.setPrototypeOf` always answered `true`** (`call-namespace-static.ts`).
   The arm's own "KNOWN LIMITATION" said `__object_setPrototypeOf` has no failure
   channel. **Stale:** #5148 cluster 2b built one — `__object_setPrototypeOf_status`,
   a pure §10.1.2.1 predicate that performs no write and answers a permissive 1
   for every receiver the writer does not own. The answer is now the conjunction
   of that ordinary bit with `__is_truthy(writer result)`, which for a `$Proxy`
   receiver IS the §10.5.2 trap's boolean (the writer's proxy front guard returns
   it instead of the obj) and for an ordinary receiver is the always-truthy obj.
   Reading a booleanish trap result through `__is_truthy` is the same rule the
   neighbouring `Reflect.defineProperty` arm already applies.
2. **`Reflect.preventExtensions` did `drop; i32.const 1`** over a result whose
   `$Proxy` front guard had already computed the §10.5.4 trap's `false`.
3. **`Reflect.ownKeys` dropped SYMBOL keys.** The arm's comment claimed "the
   native runtime does not retain symbol-keyed properties yet". **Also stale:**
   it retains them, and `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` already read them back
   with correct identity on base (measured: `ownKeys(o).length === 1` while
   `getOwnPropertySymbols(o).length === 1` on the same object). The two lists
   were simply never joined — §10.1.11.1 step 4. A `$Proxy` receiver is
   **excluded**, and that exclusion is load-bearing: `__getOwnPropertyNames`'s
   proxy front guard returns the `ownKeys` TRAP's own array, which the spec
   requires be returned as-is and which the caller still holds; appending to it
   would both mutate a user array and report keys the trap did not.
4. **`Object.getPrototypeOf` folded from the DECLARATION even when the module
   writes that binding's prototype** (`object-get-prototype-of.ts`). Measured on
   base: `var o = {}; Reflect.setPrototypeOf(o, proto)` made the inherited read
   `o.tag` resolve through `proto` — the write was already correct — while
   `Object.getPrototypeOf(o)` still answered `%Object.prototype%`. One object,
   one link, two answers. Same unsoundness #5270 step 2 recognised for
   `{ __proto__: v }`; the only difference is that the write is a statement.

Two things the fix for (4) had to get right, both measured rather than assumed:

- **It must ROUTE, not decline.** A decline in the two literal folds falls
  through to the CLASS arm, which re-folds to the compile-time prototype
  singleton — measured: the decline alone moved nothing for the JS shape. The
  check therefore claims the expression ahead of every fold and emits the
  generic `__getPrototypeOf`.
- **`ctx.dynamicProtoLiteralNodes` is NOT the fact this reader needs.** That set
  is populated by `markReceiver`, whose first branch is
  `ctx.oracle.typeFactOf(recv).kind === "class"` — and test262 rows are **JS**,
  where expando inference gives `var o = {}` an anonymous type whose symbol
  carries the VARIABLE's name, so the fact reads `{kind:"class", name:"o"}` and
  the function returns before recording the literal. (Cluster B hit the same
  trap from the other side.) A small per-`SourceFile` scan of
  `setPrototypeOf` / `__proto__ =` receiver NAMES supplies it instead, narrowed
  to bindings whose declaration is a plain object literal — the one carrier
  whose runtime answer is verified equivalent to the fold it replaces (an unset
  `$proto` reads back as `%Object.prototype%`, checked with a probe because the
  whole "a REFUSED set leaves Object.prototype" family depends on it).

#### The regression the sweep caught, and no probe did

The first cut regressed `Reflect/setPrototypeOf/return-true-if-proto-is-current.js`
pass → fail. §10.1.2.1 step 2 (SameValue → `true`) runs BEFORE the step-3
extensibility refusal, and the status native compares the two ENCODED `$proto`
references — an ordinary object's `%Object.prototype%` terminal is encoded as a
NULL field. So `Reflect.setPrototypeOf(o, Object.prototype)` on a non-extensible
ordinary `o` looked like "a different prototype" and took the refusal. The fix
asks the reader that already models the implicit terminal (`__getPrototypeOf`),
and **only when the status bit is 0** — so a live `$Proxy` never sees an extra
`getPrototypeOf` trap call, because the status native answers a permissive 1 for
exactly the set of receivers that contains proxies. Twelve probes were green at
the moment that regression existed; only the before/after row run saw it.

#### Neighbourhood regression control — zero pass → non-pass

Run in 128-row chunks, one fresh process per chunk (the runner OOMs on
>~500-row in-process sweeps — a property of the runner, not a finding). Base
measured with the file-copy A/B revert, branch measured with the exact sources
committed here (verified by re-deriving the same compiled shas).

| lane | rows | before | after | flips |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `built-ins/Proxy/**` + `built-ins/Reflect/**`, standalone (`.tmp/6651/nb-pr-{before,after}.tsv`) | 464 | 355 / 104 / 5 | **362** / 97 / 5 | +7, **0 lost** |
| `built-ins/Object/{getPrototypeOf,setPrototypeOf,getOwnPropertyNames,getOwnPropertySymbols,preventExtensions,isExtensible,keys}/**`, standalone (`.tmp/6651/nb-obj-{before,after}.tsv`) | 245 | 220 / 24 / 1 | 220 / 24 / 1 | **none** |

**Host (gc) control is a byte-identity proof.** Both edits are lane-gated (the
Reflect arm on `targetProfile.semanticProviders === "native-first"`, the
getPrototypeOf route on `ctx.standalone || ctx.wasi`), so the honest control is
that host output cannot move: 8 representative programs — a Proxy/Reflect-free
control, the three changed shapes, a `delete`-through-proxy module, a
proxy-in-the-prototype-chain module and two integrity modules — are
**8/8 byte-identical on gc** before vs after (`.tmp/6651/sha-{before,after}.txt`).
On standalone the same corpus shows exactly the intended delta: the 5 programs
that exercise a changed arm move, the other 3 are byte-identical.

Also green, all run bare: `npm run -s typecheck`; the five ratchet gates
(`check-loc-budget`, `check-func-budget`, `check-coercion-sites`,
`check:oracle-ratchet`, `check:dead-exports`); `node scripts/equivalence-gate.mjs`
(22 failing / 1720 passing, all 22 in the committed baseline — no new
regressions); `biome lint --diagnostic-level=error`; and the new pin file
`tests/issue-6651-cluster-f-proxy-reflect.test.ts`, 9/9 — **5 of the 9 verified
RED on the base commit** and 4 are guards that are green on both sides
(including the two negative directions: a legal `setPrototypeOf` still answers
`true`, and an untouched literal binding keeps the `%Object.prototype%` fold).

#### Residual sub-buckets (82 rows), with signatures

| rows | status | sub-bucket | what it needs |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 23 | fail | `*-realm*` / `cross-realm` | **environment, not the compiler** — `$262.createRealm` + a built QuickJS provider. Unmeasurable in this container. |
| 24 | fail | `*-target-is-proxy.js` (every trap) | nested-proxy forwarding over EXOTIC targets — an array's `length`, `new String("str")`'s non-configurable `length`, a RegExp's `lastIndex`, a function's `prototype`. Each row asserts across several such targets, so the rows/fix ratio is poor; 6 of the 24 also fail on host. |
| 7 | fail | `has/call-in-prototype*`, `has/call-object-create`, `set/call-parameters-prototype*`, `defineProperty/call-parameters` — "handler is the trap context" | **a proxy reached through the PROTOTYPE CHAIN never runs its trap.** Probed directly: `Object.create(proxy)` resolves the proxy to its TARGET as the prototype, so a trapless proxy gives correct ordinary answers and a trapped one is invisible (`Object.getPrototypeOf(heir) === p` is false; the `get`/`set`/`has` traps run ZERO times). The trap `this` IS the handler on the direct path — that half is correct. The blocker is architectural: `$Object.$proto` is typed `ref null $Object` and `$Proxy` is not a subtype, so the chain cannot hold a proxy at all. |
| 4 | fail | `Proxy/construct/{call-parameters-new-target,trap-is-null,trap-is-undefined,trap-is-undefined-no-property}` | `Reflect.construct(P, args, NT)` on a proxy target passes **the proxy itself** as NewTarget (`native-construct.ts`: "Ordinary `new proxy(...)` uses the proxy itself as NewTarget"), and the trap-absent forward re-enters the driver, which passes the INNER proxy. `__proxy_construct_dispatch` already takes newTarget as its third parameter, so the dispatch is right and the two call sites are wrong. **Deliberately not taken here:** #3371 is in-progress in another lane and owns `Reflect.construct` + NewTarget end-to-end (`reflect-construct-newtarget.ts`); threading a second NewTarget channel through the same arm would duplicate it. All 4 pass on host. |
| 3 | CE | `Proxy/construct/*-target-is-proxy` | the same NewTarget channel plus `class MyArray extends Array` — strictly harder than the 4 above. |
| 4 | fail | `deleteProperty` family + `Reflect/deleteProperty/delete-properties` | `delete` does not actually remove the entry: probed on base, `Reflect.deleteProperty(o,'prop')` returns `true` while `o.hasOwnProperty('prop')` stays `true` and `o.prop` is still 42. A tombstone/closed-struct gap (#4745), not a proxy gap. |
| 4 | fail | `getOwnPropertyDescriptor/*` — "X should be an own property" | the gOPD trap-absent forward over exotic targets; 3 of 4 fail on host too. |
| 1 | fail | `Reflect/setPrototypeOf/return-false-if-target-is-not-extensible.js` | **localised, not mysterious:** `Object.preventExtensions` records non-extensibility in the integrity BAG for a carrier that is not an `$Object`, and `__object_setPrototypeOf_status` returns a permissive 1 for exactly those carriers, so the refusal is invisible. The TS shape (`const o: any = {}`) already answers `false`; only the JS `var o = {}` carrier does not. Fixing it means teaching the status native to consult `__object_isExtensible` — which would be a no-op, since the same non-`$Object` test makes it return 1 first. The real fix is carrier promotion, in the integrity subsystem. |
| 2 | fail | `Reflect/ownKeys/{order-after-define-property,return-on-corresponding-order-large-index}` | **both moved to a narrower failure in this slice.** The symbol half of `order-after-define-property` now passes; it fails on a `new String("")` wrapper, whose exotic `length` is pushed at the END of `__getOwnPropertyNames` where §10.1.11.1 wants it in creation order (before later string keys). The large-index row needs `4294967294` classified as an array index and `12345678900` as a string key. |
| 10 | fail/CE | singletons | `Reflect.apply(fn, null, null)` must throw (CreateListFromArrayLike), `Reflect.construct(<non-ctor>, [])` must throw (IsConstructor on the TARGET — the newTarget check exists, the target check does not), `Reflect.hasOwnProperty` CE, `Proxy/getPrototypeOf/not-extensible-same-proto` invariant, `Proxy/enumerate`, `Proxy/set/trap-is-null-receiver`, and the `Proxy/apply/*-target-is-proxy` pair. |

**Not started in this slice, and why:** the two largest measurable buckets are
the 24 nested-proxy-over-exotic-target rows (many mechanisms per row) and the
7 prototype-chain rows (blocked on `$Object.$proto` being unable to hold a
`$Proxy` — a type-graph change, not a call-site one). The 4+3 `construct` rows
are a single, clean mechanism but sit inside #3371's active surface.

## Manifest generator note

Partition rule applied to the 1,320 non-pass rows, first match wins:
