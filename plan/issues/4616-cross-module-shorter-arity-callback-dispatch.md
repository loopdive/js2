# shorter-arity callbacks from later modules miss the funcref dispatch

## Problem

jest's diff-sequences declares `foundSubsequence(nCommon, aCommon, bCommon)`
(3 params) while every upstream test passes a 1-param arrow
(`(nCommon) => { n += nCommon; }`) — legal JS (surplus arguments ignored).
The typed-signature call-site lane builds its funcref dispatch cascade from
(a) the declared signature's wrapper type plus return variants and (b) a scan
of `ctx.closureInfoByTypeIdx` retaining SHORTER-arity closures — but (b) only
sees closures **already compiled**. A callback defined in a LATER module
(diff-sequences' index.ts compiles before the test module that defines the
arrows) is invisible, its funcref type never becomes a dispatch arm, and the
cascade's terminal throws TypeError ("Cannot access property on null or
undefined"). Reduction: `tests/issue-4616-shorter-arity-callback.test.ts`.

## Fix (landed)

Eagerly create the shorter-arity PREFIX wrapper types
(`sigParamWasmTypes.slice(0, k)` for k < sigParamCount × {declared, externref,
void} returns) as dispatch candidates. `getOrCreateFuncRefWrapperTypes` is
get-or-create/canonical, so the later-compiled closure reuses the identical
funcref type and the existing per-candidate arm (which marshals only the
candidate's formal prefix and packs surplus into `__extras_argv`) matches.

## Remaining (this issue stays open)

The full generated diff-sequences test module STILL fails its callback tests
(15/48) with order-sensitive behavior:

- Unmodified module: `dereferencing a null pointer` inside `diffSequence` —
  a guarded wrapper-root cast nulls for a callback value (the #2873 family:
  wrapper hierarchy/order); inserting an unrelated export that calls
  `countCommonStrictEquality` directly makes the trap vanish.
- With the trap gone, `countCommonStrictEquality([0], [-0])` answers 0
  (want 1): the 2-param `isCommon` callback either never runs or its boxed
  `0 === -0` comparison misanswers **in this module only** — the standalone
  reduction (`Array<unknown>` element compare) answers `true` correctly.

Both need the wrapper-family/order investigation (why a cast to the wrapper
ROOT can null for a same-program closure), not more candidate seeding.

WAT finding (2026-08-22, dstest2 probe): in the FULL generated module, a
`diff(a.length, b.length, arrow1, arrow2)` call site compiles to TWO
`__make_callback(id, closure)` registrations and NO call at all — the arrows
were classified as HOST callback arguments (`isHostCallbackArgument`:
`funcMap.get("diff")` misses — the alias registration maps the local default-
import name only in some module layouts — and the #1300 checker
`getCallSignatures` fallback apparently also missed here), and the callee
itself resolved to nothing, so the whole call was dropped. `isCommon` call
count measured 0. The SAME import + call shape in a small two-module
reduction compiles to a direct `diffSequence` call and passes. So the
residual is: (a) why `diff` resolves in small modules but not inside the
63-test generated module (suspect: compile order of the alias registration
vs the __diag/test bodies, or prelude interference), and (b) the
order-sensitive wrapper-root null in the layout where the call DOES go
through (`__call_fn_method_1` dynamic chain).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Cross-module shorter-arity callback reduction round-trips.
- [ ] jest diff-sequences upstream file ≥ 40/48.
