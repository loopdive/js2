# #2040 — standalone generator/destructuring runtime-semantics residual

## Problem

The largest *runtime* (not compile) residual in the standalone lane:
~1,750 gap tests compile, instantiate, and run, but fail assertions. Host mode
passes all of them. Two clusters:

**A. `dstr/` directories (1,112 rows)** — destructuring evaluation semantics
through the native (pure-Wasm, #1665) generator/iterator machinery:

| Count | Failing assertion | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| ~450 | `assert.notSameValue(x, values)` (assert #6, `returned 7`) | array **rest** pattern `[...x] = values` must create a *new* array from the iterator ([§8.6.2 IteratorBindingInitialization, BindingRestElement](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-iteratorbindinginitialization)); standalone aliases the source array |
| ~165 | `assert.sameValue(x, <n>)` element/default values | iterator-driven element binding gets wrong value (off-by-one `next()` consumption or default applied when value present) |
| ~120 | `returned 2`/`L#:#` empty error in `meth-ary-ptrn-rest-*` | rest-pattern via method params |
| ~90 | `array element access out of bounds [in C_method()]` | rest/elision indexing past materialized length |
| rest | `dflt-*` lazy-default families | defaults evaluated eagerly or not at all |

Example: `language/statements/class/dstr/async-gen-meth-static-dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-ary-rest-iter.js`
returns 7 (assert #6 `assert.notSameValue(x, values)`) on main @ 936d1ac51 —
the rest binding `x` IS the source iterable instead of a fresh array.

**B. generator / class-elements (639 rows)** — generator-object semantics:

| Count | Failing assertion | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| ~140 | `assert.sameValue(executed, false)` / `assert.sameValue(accessed, false)` | eager evaluation of code that must be lazy (generator body runs at call instead of first `next()`, or property getter probed during compile-time dispatch) |
| ~220 | `assert.sameValue(c.m().next().value, 42)` / `C.m().next().value` | generator **methods** (incl. static, private-name `#m`, computed) return wrong `value` — plain `function*` passes, the method/private forms diverge |
| ~50 | `assert.sameValue(inst.getPrivateReference(), 'get string')` etc. | private accessor/method references inside generator bodies |
| ~48 | `"arguments" in this === false` (eval-code/direct) | overlaps #1066 eval scope — exclude from this issue |

## Why one issue

Both clusters sit on the same machinery: the native generator state machine
(#1665) + IteratorBindingInitialization codegen. A dev fixing rest-pattern
copy semantics and `next()` consumption order will touch the same
`src/codegen` generator/destructuring lowering for A and most of B's
`next().value` rows. If the architect prefers, split A (destructuring
evaluation order, ~1,100) from B (generator-object/private-elements, ~590)
after the first WAT-level diagnosis.

## Suggested approach

1. Start with the highest-leverage single bug: **BindingRestElement must
   `ArrayCreate` + append from the iterator**, never alias. (~450 rows.)
2. Then audit `next()` consumption order for `ary-ptrn-elem-*` with defaults:
   spec order is: call `next()` once per element, use default only when
   `done` or value `undefined`.
3. For B: compare WAT of `class C { *m() { yield 42; } }` (passes) vs the
   failing `new-sc-line-gen-rs-privatename-identifier-initializer.js` form to
   find where method-position generators diverge.

## Investigation (sd-3, 2026-06-21) — cluster A rest-identity diagnosis

Reproduced on current origin/main via `runTest262File` (HOST vs STANDALONE):
`class/dstr/*ary-ptrn-rest*` → **HOST 12/12 pass, STANDALONE 6/12**; the 6 fails
are all `assert.notSameValue(x, values)` (`returned 7`, assert #6): the rest
array `x` reads as **reference-identical** to the source `values`.

**Ruled OUT — the codegen DOES build a fresh rest array in BOTH lanes:**
- Typed `method([...x]: number[])` → fresh (`array.new_default`+`array.copy`+
  `struct.new`, the `__rest_arr` build at destructuring-params.ts:1644-1681).
- UNTYPED `method([...x])` (the exact test262 shape, externref param arm) →
  the full `$C_method` WAT *also* contains `array.copy:1` + `array.new_default:5`:
  the externref param is materialized to a fresh `resultLocal` vec, then the rest
  copies that into `x`. So `x` is a copy-of-a-copy — structurally NOT the source.

**So the alias is NOT a missing rest copy. PROVED via pure-standalone probes
(no harness, bare `{}` instantiate):**
- `class C { method([...x]){ x.push(99); ... } }; method(values)` → after the
  call `values.length === 3` and `x.length === 4`: **`x` is structurally a fresh,
  independent array** (mutating it does not touch `values`).
- `Object.is(x, values)` for the rest case returns **`0` (NOT same)** — correct;
  `Object.is(distinct arrays)`=0, `Object.is(same)`=1, `===` on distinct arrays=0
  all correct standalone.

**Conclusion: the destructuring rest codegen AND `Object.is`/reference-identity
are CORRECT in pure standalone.** The `assert.notSameValue(x, values)` failure
manifests ONLY through the test262 **harness-wrapped** path (the harness
`assert.js` + `env`-import instantiate the runner provides; a bare `{}`
instantiate of the harness traps on `Import #0 "env"`). So the headline ~450-row
cluster A is most likely NOT a destructuring/generator lowering bug at all — it is
either a `harness/assert.js` `notSameValue` lowering issue or a host-bridge
marshaling-identity artifact specific to the runner, surfacing only when the two
vecs cross the `env` boundary for the assert.

**NEXT SESSION (re-scope before coding):** run ONE failing file under the runner
with the rest binding replaced by an in-wasm `Object.is(x, values)` return (no
`assert`) to confirm the codegen value is right and isolate `assert.notSameValue`;
then inspect `assert.notSameValue`/`SameValue` lowering + the runner's `env`
marshaling (`__make_iterable`, vec→JS) for an identity collapse. The fix is very
likely in the marshaling/`SameValue` path, NOT destructuring-params.ts — which
would re-scope cluster A's count substantially. The `directCastInstrs` fast-path
(destructuring-params.ts:1122-1126, `resultLocal = param` no-copy for an already-
`__vec_externref` param) was checked and is NOT the cause (the rest still builds a
fresh vec downstream: the untyped `$C_method` WAT has `array.copy:1`).

Orthogonal smaller slice found: `const [a=9] = [undefined]` → NaN (default not
applied when the element value is `undefined`); spec §8.5.3 applies the default on
`undefined`, not just `done`. Independent of the rest-identity question.

## Acceptance criteria

- `assert.notSameValue(x, values)` family passes: rest pattern yields a fresh
  array (≥400 rows).
- `dflt-ary-ptrn-elem-*` default-evaluation rows pass (lazy, spec-ordered).
- Private/static generator-method `next().value` rows pass.
- Standalone baseline runtime-fail count in `dstr/` halves (≤550); host
  unchanged.
